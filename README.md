This was a cool physics-based game prototype where you would control thrusters on a futuristic hovercraft-like aircraft and fire homing missiles using your mouse.

The graphics were all suposed to be vector-based with cool shader post-processing and the whole game was to be very simulation-like with a flight compture translating high-level flight controls into individual thruster vectoring.

Got preoccupied with other things befor having a chance to finish it, you know how it is :)
